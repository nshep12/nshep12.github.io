		<h3>The First Video Game</h3>
		<p>The first video game was developed in 1958 by physicist William Higinbotham in hopes of livening up the experience 
			of the visitors to Brookhaven National Laboratory. What became the game of Pong was originally called 
			"Tennis for Two". Players turned a knob to adjust the angle of the ball and press a button to 
			hit the ball toward the other player, at that point you couldn't actually miss. The game quickly 
			became the most popular exhibit at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Over time, the creator took 
			Tennis for Two down and replaced it with another display. He thought what he was doing wasn't 
			particurlarly exciting. He eventually realized what he had and patented his game.
